# Introduction

The goal of this assignment is to implement the Deep Q-Learning algorithm with a simple continuous time 1-pendulumn enviroment.

## Folder organization

* pendulumn.py: Create a simulation environment for a N-pendulum
* pendulumn_dci.py: Describe continuous state pendulum environment with discrete control input (derived from pendulumn.py)
* DQN_templete.py: create a Neural networks using tensorflow library
